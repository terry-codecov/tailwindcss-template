# tailwindcss-template
A basic template project for learning [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) with HTML,

Fork this template

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

This will open the browser to a page (refresh for first time build), it should compile an example file fully styled.

You can edit Tailwind configs from the tailwind.config.js file and through the tailwind.css file. Tailwind is running in JIT mode
Play around with index.html or duplicate it and link to other pages (make sure it has the same css linked)

The local web server is running [BrowserSync](https://browsersync.io/), meaning you can access the dev server from your phone over wifi by entering the public IP, scrolling and navigating will be synced across your devices!

There's a tailwind dev tool installed to help you know what screen size is currently active on the bottom right of the browser window. This is not used on other codecov repos but I thought it would help get used to understanding the responsive features.

TODO: setup JS bundling.
